# EHVI-HVI
Expected hypervolume improvement (EHVI) as a hypervolume improvement

EHVI is an important concept in multi-objective Bayesian optimization. This is a Python implementation of our formulation for exactly computing EHVI in [1]. The experimental results have shown its significant advantages over previously fastest implementation in [2] for $d\ge3$. 

Our implementation also works well for exactly computing $q\mathrm{EHVI}$ (multi-point version of EHVI) within the same time complexity and the gradient of EHVI by using the method in [3].

# Technical Appendix
The appendix provides proofs and experimental results of our work [1].
